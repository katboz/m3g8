# Module 3, Guide 8

I defined a Person type with personal data like name, birth date, number of children, country, and whether the person knows how to program.

I wrote a calculateAge() function to convert birthdate strings into ages.

I performed the tasks that were required:

Is the first person older than the last?

Do the second and third people have the same number of kids?

Do the first and fourth people both know how to program?

Can I print a greeting based on the second person's country?

Is the second person's full name longer than 5 characters?
